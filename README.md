# Submarine.me

There are many NFT token-gating solutions available today, but none of them handle content distribution well. As a creator who wants to give exclusive access to media, NFT token-gating falls short. What creators need is a way to store private, verifiable content AND a method to serve that content based on ownership of an NFT.

Submarine.me—a [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) experiment—solves that.

For customers who have a [paid plan](https://www.pinata.cloud/pricing) with Pinata and a dedicated IPFS gateway, it couldn't be simpler to lock exclusive media content behind ownership of an NFT. Upload a file, add some data about the file, choose what NFT contract (contract address and EVM chain) to check on, and that's it. Creators will get a unique link that they can share, knowing that the exlusive content is safely protected from unauthorized access.

NFT projects, individual artists, brands, and more can leverage Submarine.me to easily lock and serve content.
